		<h2>Charles River Privacy Day &mdash; May 11th, 2023</h2>
		
		Please join us for a day of talks on the theory and practice of statistical data privacy! 
		Inspired by the success of the <a href="https://bostoncryptoday.wordpress.com/">Charles River Crypto Days</a>, the Charles River  
		Privacy Days will resume&mdash;after a decade-long <a href="https://www.bu.edu/cs/charles-river-privacy-day/">hiatus</a>&mdash;on 
		Thursday, May 11, 2023. The event will be followed on Friday, May 12 by a <a href="https://bostoncryptoday.wordpress.com/">Crypto Day workshop</a>.

				<li><strong>Speaker:</strong> Jessica Sorrell, University of Pennsylvania </br><strong>Title:</strong> Connections Between Replicability, Privacy, and Perfect Generalization </br> <strong>Abstract:</strong> Replicability is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of replicability have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the replicability crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that donâ€™t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.
				In this talk, we will explore connections between replicability and other stability notions that have proven useful in ensuring statistical validity. We will discuss statistical equivalences between replicability, approximate differential privacy, and perfect generalization, as well as computational separations.

				This talk is based on work with Mark Bun, Marco Gaboardi, Max Hopkins, Russell Impagliazzo, Rex Lei, Toniann Pitassi, and Satchit Sivakumar.</li>
