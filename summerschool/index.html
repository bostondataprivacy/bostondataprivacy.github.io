<div class="content box"> <h2>Differential Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Differential privacy is a strong formal notion of data privacy
    which is currently used in several applications in industry and in
    the public sector.  Differential privacy data analyses provide a strong
    statistical guarantee on the increase in harm that individuals
    can incur as a result of participating in the analyses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Differential privacy can be integrated with methods and tools from
    different areas of computer science and statistics,such as machine
    learning, databases, security, etc. Several mechanisms have been
    developed to ensure differential privacy for a wide range of
    statistical and data analysis tasks. These mechanism have been integrated in
    several software tools.
  </p>

  <p>
   The participants in the summer school will have the opportunity to
    learn about recent developments in the theory and practice of
    differential privacy.
  </p>

<h2 >Logistics</h2>
<p>
  We aim at having the school as an in person only event held on Boston University campus in Boston.
  We will monitor the status of the Covid-19 pandemic and if needed we will move the event to virtual.
</p>

<p>
  More information will be added soon.

<div  class="content box">
<h2 >Participating</h2>

<p>
  
  <p>
    We welcome students who are interested in learning about the
    recent developments in differential privacy. In particular, the
    school will be aimed at advanced graduate students and scientists
    from statistical agencies, research labs and industry.  We will
    assume that participants will have a basic knowledge of
    differential privacy and some of the basic mechanisms that can be
    used to guarantee it.
</p>

</div>

<div  class="content box">
<h2 >Program</h2>
<p>
  The school will start on Monday June 6 and end on Friday June 10,
2022. The first day we will have several lectures aimed at providing
all the participants with a common vocabulary and at introducing
participants to several related areas where differential privacy is
having an impact.  The rest of the days we will have four courses which will provide a  deep
dive on four different foundational topics in differential privacy.
</p>

<p>
We hope that the school will also be an occasion for participants to
socialize with the lecturers, organizers and the other participants.
